# Assignment 6 - Inheritance with Classes

1. Re-write your message type definitions using ES6 class syntax.

2. Add a class `Chat` to your code that encapsulates the `messages` array and all the functions that operate on that 
array (`sendMessage`, `wordsPerMember` `members`). 
    - Use getter methods, where it makes sense.
    - When calling `chat.sendMessage(message)`, the passed message shall be added to the `chat`'s `messages` array.  
Hint 1: To not get mixed up, you might want to rename the initial `messages` array, outside the `Chat` class, to 
`initialMessages`.  
Hint 2: Don't forget to instantiate your `Chat` within your initialization code.
